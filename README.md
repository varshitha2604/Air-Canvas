# Air-Canvas
This project aims to virtualize the learning process and replace the traditional methods of learning by providing a platform to write or draw by detecting the movement of finger tips .
Modules like Opencv are used to detect the motion of the hand and an option to select different colors will also be provided.
The only requirement is a computer or laptop enabled with a webcam or a built-in camera.
